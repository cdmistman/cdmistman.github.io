I'm a fourth-year Northeaster University student, in the program to get my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and Business Administration (management).
Currently, my planned graduation is in December of 2021.

I'm from San Jose, CA, but am currently located in Boston, MA.

I'm an avid programmer, with knowledge in about 15 different programming languages, but my favorite by far is Rust.
I'm an Editor for This Week in Rust, the Rust Community Team's weekly newsletter with relevant information from all over the Rust community.

In my free time, you'll see me working on personal projects, watching TV, or playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate.
