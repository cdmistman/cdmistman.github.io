    <p>Just today, I decided to re-watch the documentary The Great Hack.
It's really got me questioning: what is safe?</p>
<p>I know that every single click in my browser sends another valuable piece of information to some company.
For example, did you know that simply going to the website for CNN, one of the largest media providers in the US, results in an HTTP request to one adnxs.com?
(Of course, there's a lot more to the URL in the HTTP request, but that's the important part.)
What is this URL?
Well, it forwards to the company website Xandr, which is one of the largest data collection companies in the nation.
Has anybody heard of this company?
I know I haven't.</p>
<p>But that in and of itself isn't the sketchy part.
The sketchy part is the fact that companies we do know about aren't the ones collecting our data.
Instead our data is being collected by these companies that we don't hear about in the news, we don't hear about day-to-day, and we don't hear about in any parts of our lives.
Do we know that these companies follow best-practices when it comes to cyber security?
Do we know that these companies don't sell our data (instead of just the usage of our data)?
Do we even know who owns these companies?
There is so much that these ghost companies know about us, but we've hardly heard about them.
Why is that fair?</p>
<p>My issue isn't that data is being collected.
I've known this.
This has been such an obvious part about the internet as it stands today.
I read countless news stories about the Cambridge Analytica hack as it happened, and it didn't shock me that my and my friends' information was out there.
What did shock me was that it was by a company I had never heard about, and that was the most worrisome part of it.
When I visit the website of some company, I'm explicitly giving that company permission to know more about me.
I've given permission to that company to collect data on me (I let LinkedIn know my phone number, my email address, my physical location, where I work, etc).
However, I didn't give Xandr (or any of these other ghost companies) permission to collect information on me.</p>
<p>Yes, the EU has recently pushed laws forcing websites to have a &quot;cookie notice&quot; whenever a user visits those websites, if the website is tracking the user using cookies.
However, this isn't enough.
That notice doesn't make it obvious that you're only being tracked by that website -- you're being tracked by Facebook, Google, Amazon, Xandr, and potentially dozens of other data collection companies.
Why don't all of the companies get named?
That's worrisome to say the least.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Analytica case was important at showing us the extent to which our data can be used to manipulate us, but nobody has ever mentioned the extent to which our data has been collected.
It has brought on numerous laws to give consumers access to their data from companies they know have their data, but where does it list that we must know who has our data in the first place?</p>
